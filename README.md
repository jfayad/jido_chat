`jido_chat` is the core adapter contract and canonical data model for `Jido.Chat` integrations.

## Release Status

`jido_chat` is published on Hex as part of the Jido 1.x chat package release
line.

`Jido.Chat` is an Elixir implementation aligned to the Vercel Chat SDK
([chat-sdk.dev/docs](https://www.chat-sdk.dev/docs)).

The package is intentionally scoped to the adapter layer:

- `jido_chat` owns typed content/event models, adapter contracts, typed thread/channel handles, and deterministic fallback behavior.
- `jido_messaging` owns supervised runtime concerns such as webhook ingress, delivery queues, retries, room/session state, bridge lifecycle, and process trees.

It provides:

- `Jido.Chat` as a lightweight struct + event-loop facade for local/in-memory flows
- typed thread and channel handles (`Thread`, `ChannelRef`)
- canonical outbound payloads (`Postable`, `PostPayload`, `FileUpload`, `StreamChunk`)
- rich content models (`Markdown`, `Card`, `Modal`, `ModalResponse`)
- typed normalized inbound/event payloads (`Incoming`, `Message`, `SentMessage`, `Response`, `EventEnvelope`)
- explicit adapter capability negotiation and fallback behavior (`Jido.Chat.Adapter`, `CapabilityMatrix`)
- lightweight state and concurrency hooks used by `Jido.Chat` today (`StateAdapter`, `Concurrency`)
- framework-agnostic AI history conversion (`Jido.Chat.AI`)

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:jido_chat, "~> 1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Run `mix deps.get` after adding the dependency.

## Canonical Adapter Interface

`Jido.Chat.Adapter` is the canonical contract for new integrations.
`Jido.Chat.ChannelRef` and `Jido.Chat.Thread` are the typed handles for room and thread operations.
Adapters can expose native rich posting through `post_message/3`, which receives the full
typed `Jido.Chat.PostPayload` including attachments. `send_file/3` remains the low-level
upload hook used by the core fallback path for single-upload posts.

## Adapter Author Checklist

1. Implement the required `Jido.Chat.Adapter` callbacks for your transport.
2. Declare explicit surface support through `capabilities/0` instead of relying on callback inference.
3. If you build directly on the lightweight `Jido.Chat` facade and ship a custom `Jido.Chat.StateAdapter`, implement `lock/5`, `release_lock/3`, and `force_release_lock/2`, and persist `locks` plus `pending_locks` in snapshots.
4. Treat `Jido.Chat.PostPayload` as the canonical outbound contract. It can now carry text, markdown, raw payloads, cards, streams, attachments, and `FileUpload` values.
5. Run `mix quality` before publishing adapter changes.

## Usage (Core Loop)

```elixir
chat =
  Jido.Chat.new(
    user_name: "jido",
    adapters: %{telegram: Jido.Chat.Telegram.Adapter}
  )
  |> Jido.Chat.on_new_mention(fn thread, incoming ->
    Jido.Chat.Thread.post(thread, "hi #{incoming.display_name || "there"}")
  end)
```

## Additional Core Helpers

```elixir
ai_messages = Jido.Chat.AI.to_messages(history, include_names: true)

payload =
  Jido.Chat.PostPayload.new(%{
    text: "Hello",
    files: [%{path: "/tmp/report.pdf", filename: "report.pdf"}]
  })
```

## Scope Notes

- `Jido.Chat` includes lightweight subscription/state/concurrency hooks today so the core facade can run locally without a larger runtime.
- Production ingress, retries, room/session state, and supervised delivery orchestration belong in `jido_messaging`, not this package.
- The AI conversion helpers are structurally compatible with Chat SDK / AI SDK message shapes, but they keep Elixir-native naming and callback conventions.

## Reference Docs

The package-level parity matrix and migration notes are tracked in the
`proj_jido_chat` workspace while this package is moving through the 1.x release
batch.
